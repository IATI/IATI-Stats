,,,,,"*The OECD DAC* data was sourced on 20/01/2016 from [https://stats.oecd.org/DownloadFiles.aspx?DatasetCode=CRS1] using the file 'CRS 2014 data.zip' that was uploaded by the OECD on the 12/01/2016. The columns used were those headed 'DonorCode', 'DonorName', 'AgencyCode', 'AgencyName' and 'usd_disbursement' which was summed for each agency.

The OECD DAC* & CRS List of Codes was accessed on 20/01/2016 using [http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/Codelist.xls]. Using the tab 'Agency' and the column 'Agency name (EN)', agencies were mapped to their corresponding full names, using the donor code and agency code information from the CRS data file.
